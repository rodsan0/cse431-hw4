# Code and Results for CSE431 -- Homework 4

Code for `Question n` can be found under its respective `qn/` folder.  
For questions 1 and 2, both the benchmarking and graphing code are inside the respective Jupyter Notebooks.  
For question 3, the benchmarking code is in `q3.cpp` while the graphing code is inside the Jupyter Notebook.  

All notebooks were re-ran before uploading, so the graphs and data might differ from the LaTeX submission. The actual graphs and data used for submission are under `results/`.
